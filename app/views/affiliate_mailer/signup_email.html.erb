Hi Authors and Affiliates,
</p>
<p>
If you are receiving this email, that means that we just allocated you a <strong>very special affiliate link</strong>.  Here’s your special link: <a href="http://healthylivingbundle.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %>" style="font-family: 'Times', serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 0.05em; color: #6c6c6c; text-decoration: none" target="_blank">http://healthylivingbundle.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %></a>.  You can use it to promote our pre-launch campaign for the upcoming flash sale of Ultimate Healthy Living Bundle 2014.  <strong>The best way to promote this campaign is to send out the email sequence (or your version of them) found at the end of this email.</strong>  We hired a fancy-pants copywriter to put these together for us, and we expect them to convert very well.  And there’s more to come too.  Although they are not set-up yet, we will load them all into the affiliate portal for you shortly. 
</p>
<p>
The Pre-Launch campaign introduces people to The 4-Step Guide to Your Healthiest Year, and is designed to get folks thinking about the small actionable changes they can make in their life to live their healthiest year ever in 2015.  They’ll also get the chance to purchase The Ultimate Healthy Living Bundle 2014 during our 48-hour flash sale.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if they were referred by you they will receive a cookie in their browser.  So when they purchase the sale will be credited to you. (*We think the last-cookie system is the fairest, so that’s what we use.  In the cases where there are multiple referrers, only the last one receives credit for the sale).
</p>
<p>
When they sign up for the guide, they will also receive a unique referral code (different them yours) that they can share with their friends, and those friends can share with their friends...and it will keep on going as long as they keep sharing!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Here’s what’s amazing...</strong> Your unique affiliate cookie will be tied to anyone who refers their friends (and then their friends and their friends) from your original link!  Each new person that signs up is effectively sharing your cookie with their friends, which ultimately means more sales for you.  And there are some really cool incentives to get people sharing.  
</p>
<p>
As you may remember, we ran a version of this campaign last time and a solid 13% of those that signed up ultimately purchased the bundle.  We’ve refined our process this time, so we’re hopefully expectant that we’ll be able to increase both the number of shares and the conversion percentage, resulting in even better sales results for you. 
</p>
<p>
When does the pre-launch campaign finish?
</p>
<p>
We will be shutting down the pre-launch campaign on December 24th due to Christmas and in preparation for the Flash Sale on the 29th and 30th.  For the best results, I’d highly recommend that you schedule the following 4 emails (or a version of them with your personal touch) to go out one day apart starting on Monday.  They were written for us by a protege of the legendary Jay Abraham, and we expect them to have a sizeable impact on your sales.

Email 1 - End of the year
</p>
<p>
Hi <Name>,
</p>
<p>
Rewind back to January of 2014 — you likely made plans back then for yourself. You perhaps even took up some new year’s resolutions.
</p>
<p>
You likely vowed to improve and transform yourself...to be in better health, to be in better shape, to live a longer life.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward back to the present and tell me this: Are you where you wanted to be?
</p>
<p>
If you are, if you’ve truly reached the pinnacle of achievement when it comes to your health, then kudos to you.
</p>
<p>
If you are not, don’t be discouraged! I’ve been there many times myself! Don’t feel like you’ve failed or fallen short. Don’t feel like the mountain is too hard to climb.
</p>
<p>
Most of all, don’t pack it in. Not  yet.
</p>
<p>
I’m a big believer in the saying: “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”
</p>
<p>
So let’s make a deal, right here and right now. Let’s take our first step to reclaiming our health. Let’s reclaim what belongs to us and nudge it in the right direction with one simple change.

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Email #2- Loved Ones</p>
<p>
Hi <Name>,
</p>
There is probably someone out there who loves you more than you love yourself...your parents, your significant other, your kids, your friends...it could be anybody.
</p>
<p>
If I asked them about how kind 2014 was to your personal health and well being, what would they say?
</p>
<p>
Would they give you a smashing endorsement? Would they commend you for your effort and consistency all year?
</p>
<p>
Or would they be concerned?
</p>
<p>
I ask these heavy questions because we often fall into the trap of thinking that health is a matter that no one else has a stake in. But our loved ones do.
</p>
<p>
At this time of the year, it’s not that uncommon to mentally “check out” of every activity that requires your effort and concentration. It’s not uncommon to stop physical activity or eating salads or put on the holiday pounds with the same loved ones we hold near and dear.
</p>
<p>
So here’s what I want you to do.
</p>
<p>
Join me in the FREE 4-Day Healthy Living Challenge (INSERT YOUR SPECIAL AFFILIATE LINK HERE:  http://healthylivingbundle.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %>): 4 simple steps to a healthier, better you. Each step will take you no more than 5 minutes a day. 
</p>
<p>
Make a decision to make a change today, not AFTER the holidays are over and you are at your New Year’s Eve party.
</p>
<p>
The challenge is so easy, so simple, yet so effective. Most of all: it will change your life.
</p>
<p>
Learn more and sign up for the challenge here. 
</p>
<p>
You loved ones will thank you. Maybe you’ll even inspire a few of them to join you.
</p>
<p>
Best,<br>
YOUR NAME
</p>
<p>
P.S. Your loved ones have a major stake in your health. And you surely want to be there for them when it matters. Start the challenge now. (INSERT YOUR SPECIAL AFFILIATE LINK HERE:  http://healthylivingbundle.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %>)  Remember, it’s free!
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Email #3- Keep it Simple</p>
<p>
Hi <name>,
</p>
<p>
How many times have you “tried harder” to improve your health? How many times have you “tried harder” than the last time, only to fail again?
</p>
<p>
You probably beat yourself up afterwards. You probably told yourself that if you just tried harder the next time around, you’d succeed.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a secret: no you wouldn’t. Trying harder has never been your issue.
</p>
<p>
Instead, you should be trying different. Trying simpler.
</p>
<p>
Most people overcomplicate the process of improving their health. They think the silver bullet is in the complexity, in the personal trainers, in the protein shakes, in the gym memberships.
</p>
<p>
But it’s actually the opposite.
</p>
<p>
The silver bullet is in you. In the knowledge you have. In the decisions you make. In the consistency you achieve.
</p>
<p>
So we’re going to make things simpler for you today. We’re going to make improving your health a no brainer.

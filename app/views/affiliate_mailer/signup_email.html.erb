Hi Authors and Affiliates,
</p>
<p>
If you are receiving this email, that means that we just allocated you a <strong>very special affiliate link</strong>:  <a href="http://stressfreehomemaking.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %>" target="_blank">http://stressfreehomemaking.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %></a>.
</p>
<p>
Starting today (<strong>Tuesday, March 17th</strong>) you can use this link to share our official 4-Step Creativity campaign for The Ultimate DIY Bundle 2015 (FLASH SALE) with your readers, followers, and subscribers until 11:59 on Friday March 27th.
</p>

What’s in it for you?
</p>
<p>
Everyone that is referred by you receives a cookie in their browser.  If they purchase the Ultimate DIY Bundle, you get credit and commission for the sale.
</p>
<p>
But here’s where it gets really cool!  If someone that you referred shares about the mini-course with their friends (and they sign up), their friends will also receive your affiliate cookie.  If that friend buys a copy of the bundle, you’ll also receive the full credit and commission for that sale.  And if that person shares about the mini-course with their friends…well, you get the idea.  Each new person that signs up is effectively sharing your cookie with their friends, which ultimately means more sales for you.  The potential for an exponential impact on your sales is very real.
</p>
<p>
This is a really great opportunity to promote the bundle without having to “sell” something.  The mini-course is free, and will be of value to them regardless of whether or not the purchase an Ultimate DIY Bundle.
</p>

What’s in it for your readers?
</p>
<p>
Written in consultation with MyQuillyn from <a href="http://thenester.com">TheNester.com</a>, this mini-course is intended to inspire folks to rediscover their creative side in 2015.  It’s a simple course, and takes them through a short exercise in each of the 4 steps.
</p>
<p>
In addition to accessing the course, each subscriber will have the opportunity to earn some pretty awesome rewards by sharing it with their friends.  These include:
</p>
<p>
- <strong>$5 off the Ultimate DIY Bundle</strong> (only 1 Referral)<br>
- <strong>A FREE 1-year Subscription to Better Homes and Gardens Magazine</strong> (Only 5 Referrals)<br>
- <strong>A FREE Ultimate DIY Bundle</strong> (only 10 referrals) PLUS the free 1-year BH&G subscription mentioned above (Only 10 Referrals)
</p>
<p>
And on March 29th, each subscriber will be given the opportunity to purchase their copy of the Ultimate DIY Bundle 2015. 
</p>
<p>
The mini-course will only be available for this week and a half, and we’ll redirect the site to the official Ultimate DIY Bundle site after 11:59 PM on March 29th.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
What to do next?
</p>
<p>
Your first step is to log in to the affiliate portal.  You can find everything you need for promoting the pre-launch campaign and the bundle there, including sales copy, banners, marketing ideas, and tons more.  
</p>
<p>
Because the mini-course is only available for 10 days, I’d recommend starting promoting right away to give a chance for your referrals to share it with their friends, etc.
</p>
<p>
Thanks Friends.   It’s a privilege once again to be able to partner with you!  Thanks for giving us the opportunity to do so once again!!
</p>
<p>
To Your Success,
</p>

P.S. As authors and affiliates, the benefit you receive is the commission that you earn on any sales.  The “share-with-a-friend rewards” are intended for the general public only.  
</p>
<p>
However, if you’d prefer to earn these rewards instead of commission on any resulting sales, you can simply sign up for the ecourse with a different email address than this one, and use the new code that you are provided with to promote the course.

Hi Authors and Affiliates,

If you are receiving this email, that means that we just allocated you a very special affiliate link: http://4stepcreativity.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %>

You can use this link to share our official pre-launch campaign for The Ultimate DIY Bundle 2015 with your readers, followers and subscribers until 11:59 on January 20th.

What’s in it for your readers?
Written in consultation with MyQuillyn from TheNester.com, this mini-course is intended to inspire folks to rediscover their creative side in 2015.  It’s a simple course, and takes them through a short exercise in each of the 4 steps.

In addition to accessing the course, each subscriber will have the opportunity to earn some pretty awesome rewards by sharing it with their friends.  These include:

- $5 off the Ultimate DIY Bundle (only 1 Referral)
- A FREE 1-year Subscription to Better Homes and Gardens Magazine (Only 5 Referrals)
- A FREE Ultimate DIY Bundle (only 10 referrals) PLUS the free 1-year BH&G subscription mentioned above (Only 10 Referrals)

And on January 21st, each subscriber will be given the opportunity to purchase their copy of the Ultimate DIY Bundle 2015.

The mini-course will only be available for 1 week tops, and we’ll redirect the site to the official Ultimate DIY Bundle site after 11:59 PM on January 20th.

What’s in it for you?
Everyone that is referred by you receives a cookie in their browser.  If they purchase the Ultimate DIY Bundle, you get credit and commission for the sale.

But here’s where it gets really cool!  If someone that you referred shares about the mini-course with their friends (and they sign up), their friends will also receive your affiliate cookie.  If that friend buys a copy of the bundle, you’ll also receive the full credit and commission for that sale.  And if that person shares about the mini-course with their friends…well, you get the idea.  Each new person that signs up is effectively sharing your cookie with their friends, which ultimately means more sales for you.  The potential for an exponential impact on your sales is very real.

We obviously don’t know what the conversion rates will be this time around, but in a recent bundle we saw 66% of folks who visited our pre-launch campaign page sign up for the mini-course.  And a full 13% of those ended up purchasing a bundle.

This is also a really great opportunity to promote the bundle without having to “sell” something.  The mini-course is free, and will be of value to them regardless of whether or not the purchase an Ultimate DIY Bundle.

What to do next
Your first step is to log in to the affiliate portal.  You can find everything you need for promoting the pre-launch campaign and the bundle there, including sales copy, banners, marketing ideas, and tons more.  I couldn’t include your login details in this email, but look for any other email from us in the last week or two, and you should see your login details for the portal.

To help you out, we’ve had some promotional emails pre-written for you by a professional copywriter.  If you are going to use these, the best approach is to see these as templates and edit them to suit your voice / approach / etc. before sending them out.  But if you don’t have the time, you can feel free to send them out as is.

Because the mini-course is only available for 1 week, I’d recommend starting promoting right away to give a chance for your referrals to share it with their friends, etc.

Thanks Friends.   It’s a privilege once again to be able to partner with you!  Thanks for giving us the opportunity to do so once again!!

To Your Success,

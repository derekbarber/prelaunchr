Hi <%= @user.name %>,
</p>
<p>You just requested our mini course, “Four Steps to Rediscover Your Inner Creative Genius”.  Awesome!</p>
<p>
This 4-day mini-course is not really for those that consider themselves accomplished artists, but rather for the rest of us to rediscover the joy of creativity in our daily lives.  In our homes, with our kids, with our spouses.  It’s about expressing our creative sides in midst of the “mundane.”
</p>
<p>
You should receive an email from me today with the first step, and then the other 3 steps spaced out over the next few days.
</p>
<p>
If you haven’t already, add our email address to your address book so that you are sure to receive those emails. We’re so excited for this next year and what it holds for you!
</p>
<p>
If you know others that would benefit from this mini-course, you can let them know sharing your unique link: <a href="http://healthylivingbundle.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %>" target="_blank">http://4stepcreativity.com/?ref=<%= @user.referral_code %></a>
</p>
<p>
In addition to helping them rediscover their creative side, you’ll also earn some awesome rewards.  With just 5 referrals, you’ll receive a free 1-year subscription to <a href="http://www.discountmags.com/magazine/better-homes-and-gardens">Better Homes and Gardens Magazine</a> (from my friends at <a href="http://discountmags.com">DiscountMags.com</a>).  And 10 referrals will get you FREE access to over $1,200 of awesome DIY resources to inspire your creative side all year long.
</p>
<p>
But enrolment to the mini-course is only available until 11:59 PM on January 20th, so make sure they check it out before then
</p>
<p>
You can check out the details, and keep an eye on how many referrals you’ve made at any time by revisiting 4stepcreativity.com on the computer or device that you originally signed up on.
</p>
<p>
To Your Inner Creative Genius!

It will only be available for a few days, but contains over $1,200 worth of creative inspiration for a shockingly low price.  That’s all I can say for now, but I’ll let you know more soon.

P.S. Towards the end of December we’ll be giving you a very short window of opportunity to purchase our Ultimate Healthy Living Bundle 2014.  In September almost 20,000 people like you picked up a copy.  But after the short sale ended, we had a tonne of emails from folks who missed it and wanted to get their copy.  Although we weren’t able to accommodate them at the time, we’ve been able to negotiate the rights to sell it again for 2 days only.  We’ll notify you when it’s available, so keep an eye out for those emails.
